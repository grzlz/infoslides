## Key Findings

### What We Have
- Builder Pattern: Fully implemented with SlideBuilder
- Director Pattern: SlideDirector orchestrates complex sequences
- Strategy Pattern: StyleStrategy + LayoutStrategy
- Factory Pattern: BuilderFactory, StrategyFactory
- Registry Pattern: Dynamic builder and tenant management
- Validation System: Built into SlideBuilder with hooks
- Multi-tenant Support: Complete isolation via TenantRegistry

### What We Need
- 12 Data Models (currently have 1: Slide.js)
  - 4 Dialogue models (DialogueContent, Speaker, Message, CodeBlock)
  - 3 Instagram models (Topic, InstagramMetadata, Caption)
  - 5 Video models (VideoClip, CompositeOperation, FrameSequence, ExportConfig, ExportedVideo)
  - 3 Pipeline models (PipelineRequest, PipelineResult, PipelineError)

- 1 New Builder: DialogueSlideBuilder (extends SlideBuilder)
- 1 New Strategy: InstagramStyleStrategy (extends StyleStrategy)
- 6 Services: DialogueSlideRenderer, CanvasRenderer, VideoManager, VideoCompositor, VideoExporter, ContentPipeline
- 1 Component: DialogueSlide.svelte
- 50 Total new files (12 models + 6 services + tests)

### Risk Level: LOW
Why? Existing patterns are proven. We're adding components, not rebuilding.

### Estimated Timeline: 84-108 hours (2-3 weeks)
- Phase 1 (Models): 8-12 hours
- Phase 2 (Builders): 16-20 hours
- Phase 3 (Rendering): 20-24 hours
- Phase 4 (Video): 24-32 hours
- Phase 5 (Pipeline): 16-20 hours

---

## Critical Decisions Already Made

1. DialogueSlideBuilder should extend SlideBuilder (consistency)
2. InstagramStyleStrategy should be separate (unique constraints)
3. Video models in models/, video logic in services/
4. AI integration via adapter pattern (mockable, flexible)

---

## Implementation Sequence

```
PHASE 1: Define 12 data models with JSDoc interfaces
         └─> Create models/dialogue/, models/instagram/, models/video/, models/pipeline/

PHASE 2: Implement DialogueSlideBuilder and InstagramStyleStrategy
         └─> Both extend existing base classes (TextSlideBuilder, CorporateStyleStrategy)

PHASE 3: Create rendering components (DialogueSlide.svelte, canvas integration)
         └─> Renders dialogue content to frames

PHASE 4: Build video pipeline (VideoManager, VideoCompositor, VideoExporter)
         └─> Composites frames onto background video, exports MP4

PHASE 5: Implement ContentPipeline orchestrator
         └─> Full end-to-end: Topic → AI → Build → Render → Composite → Export
```

**Start with Phase 1. Don't skip it.**

## Next Steps

1. Read ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.txt (now, 15 min)
2. Review the sequence diagram: `/docs/sequence-diagram.mmd`
3. Study existing TextSlideBuilder: `/src/lib/builders/TextSlideBuilder.js`
4. Study existing SlideBuilder: `/src/lib/patterns/SlideBuilder.js`
5. Plan Phase 1 models based on ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md Section 4
6. Start implementing from IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md

## FAQ

**Q: Do we have enough architecture?**
A: YES. 100% ready for builders, director, factory patterns. Need to add data models.

**Q: Should we use TypeScript?**
A: No. Project uses JavaScript + JSDoc. Use @typedef for interfaces.

**Q: Can we start building without models?**
A: No. Models define contracts. Define all 12 models first.

**Q: How long for Phase 1?**
A: 8-12 hours for models + tests. Don't rush this.

**Q: Are existing patterns sufficient?**
A: YES. Don't invent new patterns. Follow existing TextSlideBuilder/StyleStrategy pattern.

**Q: What about the AI service?**
A: Adapter pattern. ContentPipeline receives AI instance. Can mock for testing.

**Q: Is video compositing complex?**
A: Yes. Budget 24-32 hours for Phase 4. FFmpeg + frame synchronization.

**Q: Should we test as we go?**
A: YES. Create tests alongside implementation, not after.
