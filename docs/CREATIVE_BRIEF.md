### Script

```
[Minecraft parkour background - player jumping across floating blocks]

KOBE BRYANT:
"Listen. Go has goroutines built into the language‚Äî
lightweight threads, you spawn thousands without breaking
a sweat. Garbage collector handles memory, static typing
catches bugs at compile time, and channels make concurrency
actually readable‚Äî"

KANYE WEST: [interrupts]
"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT KOBE BRYANT?"

[Beat - Kobe stares]
